## SkinGenie (in development)

Skin Genie is a recommendation system that generates a skincare routine for a user from their input.

## Design

The user fills out a brief questionnaire to determine skin type, skin goals, and their sensitivity. Each answer is assigned a specific keyword score, the list of keywords are sent to my API and run through my recommendation algorithm that returns a list of products. Specifically, a cleanser, serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen. This project is a refactor of a project I built five years ago with an update, improved stack, and an enhanced recommendation algorithm that improves with every users.
